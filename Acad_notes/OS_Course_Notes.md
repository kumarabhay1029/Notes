## 1. **Overview**

Operating Systems (OS) are integral to computer systems, serving as intermediaries between hardware, software, and users. This course covers the core components, functions, and concepts of operating systems, with a focus on Linux fundamentals and shell programming.

---

## **2. Major Functions of an OS**

### **Process Management**
- Manages processes (programs in execution).
- Allocates CPU, handles multitasking, and ensures proper execution.

### **Memory Management**
- Allocates and deallocates memory to programs.
- Manages virtual memory and caching.

### **Storage Management**
- Manages data storage devices (e.g., HDDs, SSDs).
- Handles file systems and data retrieval.

### **Protection Management**
- Ensures security and access control.
- Protects data and resources from unauthorized access.

---

## **3. Fundamentals of Linux**
- Introduction to Linux architecture.
- Basics of file systems, shell commands, and scripting.

---

## **4. Commands and Shell Programming**
- Learn shell scripting to automate tasks.
- Overview of essential Linux commands.

---

## **5. Computer as a System**

### **Why "Computer System"?**
- A **system** is a group of interrelated elements working together to achieve a common goal.
- A **computer system** processes data to generate information.

### **Components of a Computer System**
| **Component** | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware**  | Physical and tangible components of the computer system (e.g., I/O devices).   |
| **Software**  | Programs and algorithms enabling tasks on the hardware.                        |
| **Firmware**  | Software closely integrated with hardware (e.g., BIOS).                       |
| **Liveware**  | Living beings (users) interacting with the computer system.                   |

## **6. Drilling Down to OS**

### **Elements of OS**
- OS falls under the category of **System Software**.

---

### **Types of Software**
| **Type**             | **Description**                                                                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application Software** | Programs designed to perform tasks for end-users.                                               |
| **System Software**      | Software required for the proper functioning of the computer system.                            |

---

### **Categories of Application Software**
1. **General Purpose**:  
   - Used for common tasks (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets).  
   - Example: Office applications.
2. **Specific Purpose**:  
   - Tailored to a particular application or task.  
   - Example: Weather monitoring systems.

---

## **7. System Software Categories**

### **1. Device Drivers**
- Enable communication between hardware devices and the computer.
- Example: Printer driver allows a computer to interact with a printer.

---

### **2. Utility Software**
- Tools for analyzing, configuring, and maintaining a computer system.
- Example: Disk cleanup tools, file compression utilities.

---

### **3. Operating System**
- Manages hardware and provides a platform for application software.
- Acts as an intermediary between the user and hardware.

| **Two Views** | **Description**                                                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User View** | Focuses on the convenience and user-friendliness of the OS.                                    |
| **System View** | Focuses on efficiency and resource management within the OS.                                 |

## **8. Abstract View of Computer System**

A computer system can be divided into four main components:

| **Component**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware**        | Executes instructions and manages physical resources.                          |
| **Operating System**| Manages hardware and provides an interface for applications and users.         |
| **Application Programs** | Programs designed for end-users (e.g., games, word processors).            |
| **User**            | The individual interacting with the system.                                    |

### **Summary of Abstract View**
- Hardware enables execution.
- Operating System acts as a bridge.
- Applications provide functionality.
- Users interact with the system.
