# 🧠 CPU Organization & Registers — Detailed Revision Notes

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the internal organization of the CPU.
- Identify and explain the roles of different registers.
- Visualize how registers, ALU, and control unit interact using a diagram.

## 🏗️ What is CPU Organization?

- **Definition:**  
  CPU organization describes how the internal components of the CPU (ALU, CU, registers) are structured and interact to process instructions.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs calculations and logic operations.
  - **Control Unit (CU):** Directs and coordinates all CPU operations.
  - **Registers:** Small, ultra-fast storage locations for immediate data and instructions.

## 📦 Types of Registers & Their Roles

| Register Type        | Purpose                                                   | Analogy                        | Example Name   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| **Accumulator (ACC)**| Holds results of arithmetic/logic operations              | Whiteboard for calculations    | ACC           |
| **General Purpose**  | Temporary storage for data and intermediate results       | Chef’s trays for ingredients   | R0, R1, AX    |
| **Program Counter**  | Holds address of the next instruction                     | Bookmark in a book             | PC            |
| **Instruction Reg.** | Holds the current instruction being executed              | Recipe card                    | IR            |
| **Stack Pointer**    | Points to the top of the stack in memory                  | Sticky note on plate stack     | SP            |
| **Status/Flag Reg.** | Stores info about operation results (zero, carry, etc.)   | Dashboard indicator lights     | FLAGS/PSW     |

## 🔬 Deep Dive: Major Registers

### 1️⃣ **Accumulator (ACC)**
- **Role:** Primary register for all arithmetic and logic results.
- **Example:** After addition, the sum goes to the ACC.
- **Analogy:** Whiteboard for working out math before finalizing.

---

### 2️⃣ **General Purpose Registers (GPRs)**
- **Role:** Hold data temporarily for calculations and instruction execution.
- **Example:** R1 and R2 may hold values to be multiplied.
- **Analogy:** Trays for holding ingredients before use.

---

### 3️⃣ **Program Counter (PC)**
- **Role:** Keeps track of the address of the next instruction.
- **Example:** After instruction at 1050, PC updates to 1051.
- **Analogy:** Bookmark in your textbook.

---

### 4️⃣ **Instruction Register (IR)**
- **Role:** Stores the instruction currently being decoded and executed.
- **Example:** Holds "ADD R1, R2" during execution.
- **Analogy:** Chef’s recipe card for today’s dish.

---

### 5️⃣ **Stack Pointer (SP)**
- **Role:** Points to the top of the stack for temporary data and return addresses.
- **Example:** Changes as data is pushed/popped in function calls.
- **Analogy:** Sticky note marking the top plate in a stack.

---

### 6️⃣ **Status/Flag Register (FLAGS/PSW)**
- **Role:** Records and displays operation results—zero, carry, sign, overflow, etc.
- **Example:** Zero flag is set if the result of a subtraction is zero.
- **Analogy:** Car dashboard lights signaling specific conditions.

## 🔁 How Registers Interact: The Instruction Cycle

1. **Fetch:**  
   PC provides address → instruction fetched from memory → loaded into IR.
2. **Decode:**  
   CU decodes instruction in IR.
3. **Execute:**  
   Data loaded into GPRs/ACC → ALU processes → result updates ACC/GPRs/FLAGS.
4. **Store/Update:**  
   Results sent to memory/registers → PC updated for next instruction.
