# 📚 MCS-203 Operating Systems – Complete Notes

---

## 🏁 1. Introduction to Operating Systems

### 💡 What is an Operating System (OS)?
An **Operating System** is a special software that:
- Acts as a bridge between the user and computer hardware.
- Manages all hardware and software resources.
- Makes computers usable and efficient.

> **Example:** Without Windows, Linux, or macOS, your laptop would just show a blank screen!

---

### 🎯 Goals of an OS
- Make computers **easy to use**.
- Manage hardware **efficiently**.
- Allow **multiple programs** and **users** to work safely.
- Protect data and resources.

---

### 🖥️ Generations & Types of Operating Systems
#### 🏗️ Generations:
1. **First Gen:** Punch cards, no real OS.
2. **Second Gen:** Batch processing.
3. **Third Gen:** Multiprogramming, time-sharing.
4. **Fourth Gen:** Personal computers, GUIs.

#### 🏷️ Types:
- **Batch OS**
- **Multiprogramming OS**
- **Time-Sharing OS**
- **Real-Time OS**
- **Distributed OS**
- **Network OS**
- **Mobile OS**

---

### ✨ Desirable Qualities of OS
- **User-friendly**
- **Efficient**
- **Reliable**
- **Secure**
- **Scalable**

---

### 💻 Examples of Operating Systems
- Windows
- Linux
- macOS
- Android
- iOS

### 🛠️ Functions of an OS
1. **Process Management** 👥
2. **Memory Management** 🧠
3. **I/O Management** ⌨️🖨️
4. **File Management** 📁
5. **Protection & Security** 🔒
6. **Networking** 🌐
7. **User Interface / Command Interpretation** 🖱️⌨️

## 🧑‍💻 2. Process Management

### 🔄 What is a Process?
- A **process** is a running instance of a program.
- It has its own memory, resources, and state.

> **Example:** Opening Chrome starts a new process.

---

### 🆚 Process vs. Program
- **Program:** Just code on disk.
- **Process:** Code **running** in memory.

---

### 🔄 Process States
- **New:** Being created
- **Ready:** Waiting for CPU
- **Running:** Executing
- **Waiting:** Waiting for something (like I/O)
- **Terminated:** Finished

---

### 🗂️ Process Control Block (PCB)
- Data structure storing all info about a process (state, ID, registers, etc.)

---

### 📅 Process Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS:** First Come First Serve
- **SJF:** Shortest Job First
- **RR:** Round Robin
- **SRTN:** Shortest Remaining Time Next
- **Priority Based/Event Driven**
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compare turnaround, waiting, response times, etc.

---

## 🤝 3. Interprocess Communication & Synchronization

### 🔗 Interprocess Communication (IPC)
- Methods for processes to share data and messages.
  - **Shared Memory**
  - **Message Passing**

---

### ⏱️ Synchronization
- Ensures processes take turns accessing resources to **avoid conflicts**.

#### 🚻 Analogy: Single-Key Bathroom
- Only one person (process) can use it at a time; others must wait for the key.

---

### 🧰 Synchronization Tools
- **Locks:** Only one process at a time.
- **Semaphores:** Counters for controlling access.
- **Monitors & Condition Variables:** Advanced synchronization.

---

## 🚦 4. Deadlocks

### ⚠️ What is a Deadlock?
- Two or more processes **can't proceed** because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.

---

### 🕸️ Characterization of Deadlock
- **Mutual Exclusion**
- **Hold and Wait**
- **No Preemption**
- **Circular Wait**

---

### 🛡️ Dealing with Deadlocks
- **Prevention:** Avoid one of the four conditions.
- **Avoidance:** E.g., Banker’s Algorithm.
- **Detection and Recovery:** Allow deadlocks, but detect and fix.

---

## 🧠 5. Memory Management

### 🗺️ Concepts
- **Logical Address:** Used by programs.
- **Physical Address:** Actual location in memory.

---

### 🏗️ Memory Allocation Methods
- **Contiguous Allocation:** Single block per process.
- **Paging:** Divide memory into fixed-size pages.
- **Segmentation:** Divide memory into logical segments.

---

### 💾 Virtual Memory
- Uses hard disk as "extra" RAM.
- **Demand Paging:** Only loads needed pages.
- **Thrashing:** Too much swapping, slow performance.

---

## 📂 6. File Management

### 📁 Files & Directories
- Organize data into files and folders.

### 📝 File Operations
- Create, delete, read, write, rename, move.

### 🗃️ File Allocation Methods
- **Contiguous**
- **Linked**
- **Indexed**

---

## ⌨️ 7. I/O Management

### 🖨️ I/O Devices
- Keyboards, mouse, printers, disks.

### 🛢️ Disk Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS**
- **SSTF** (Shortest Seek Time First)
- **SCAN**, **C-SCAN**

### ⚡ RAID
- Redundant Array of Independent Disks for performance and reliability.

---

## 🔒 8. Protection & Security

### 🛡️ Security Threats
- Viruses, unauthorized access, data theft.

### 🧑‍💻 Authentication
- Passwords, biometrics.

### 🏛️ Security Models
- **Access Control Matrix**
- **Mandatory/Discretionary Access Control**
- **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Take-Grant Model**
- **Multilevel Security Models**

---

## 🖥️ 9. Advanced Topics

### 🖇️ Multiprocessor Systems
- Multiple CPUs in one system.

### 🌍 Distributed Operating Systems
- Many computers work together as one system.

### 📱 Mobile Operating Systems
- Designed for phones/tablets—focus on touch, battery, connectivity.
