## 📝 Topics & Key Concepts Covered

---

### 1️⃣ Enumerated Data Type (`enum`) in C

- **Definition:** User-defined type with named integer constants.
- **Syntax:** `enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };`
- **Default Values:** Starts from 0, increments by 1.
- **Usage:** Improves readability for options like days, colors, etc.
- **Example:**
  ```c
  enum Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY };
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ Typedef in C

- **Purpose:** Gives a new name (alias) to existing data types.
- **Syntax:** `typedef existing_type new_name;`
- **Benefits:**
  - Shortens long declarations (especially structures and pointers)
  - Improves code readability & maintainability
- **Examples:**
  ```c
  typedef int Number;
  typedef struct { int age; } Person;
  typedef int* IntPointer;
  ```

---

### 3️⃣ Comma Operator in C

- **Function:** Separates expressions, evaluates left-to-right, returns last value.
- **Common Use:** Multiple initializations/updates in `for` loops.
- **Example:**
  ```c
  for(int i = 0, j = 5; i < j; i++, j--) { ... }
  int a = (5, 10); // a = 10
  ```

---

### 4️⃣ Type Cast Operator in C

- **Purpose:** Converts one data type to another explicitly.
- **Syntax:** `(type) expression`
- **Examples:**
  - `float result = (float)a / b;`
  - `int y = (int)x; // from float to int`
- **Why:** Avoids unwanted type conversion errors and gets accurate results in calculations.

### 5️⃣ Types of Variables and Storage Classes in C

- **Storage Classes:**
  - `auto`: Default for local variables, lifetime = block.
  - `extern`: Global variables, accessible everywhere.
  - `static`: Persists value between function calls or file scope.
  - `register`: Hints to keep variable in CPU register.
- **Table:**

  | Storage Class | Scope    | Lifetime       | Default Value | Keyword   |
  |---------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
  | auto          | Local    | Block         | Garbage       | auto      |
  | extern        | Global   | Whole program | Zero          | extern    |
  | static        | Block    | Whole program | Zero          | static    |
  | register      | Local    | Block         | Garbage       | register  |

### 6️⃣ Python Programming Practice

- **Factorial Program:**
  - Wrote and explained a Python function to calculate factorial.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            result *= i
        return result
    ```
- **Exponential Series (`e^x`) Program:**
  - Used factorial function to compute series: \( e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + ... + \frac{x^n}{n!} \)
  - Example:
    ```python
    def exponential_series(x, n):
        sum = 1.0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            sum += (x ** i) / factorial(i)
        return sum
    ```
- **Practice Questions Provided:**
  - Factorial calculation
